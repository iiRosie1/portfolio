                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Grocery shopping is an essential part of university student life, and can pose problems when it comes to managing financial constraints. University students have noticed that groceries have become more expensive, and having that on top of tuition and housing expenses affects their nutrition. According to CBC News, food prices in 2025 could increase by 5% (Heydari 2024). Existing research shows that food costs are on the rise, and in consequence affordability becomes an important factor when it comes to grocery shopping. 
                        <br><br>According to Investopedia, buying in bulk does decrease the cost per unit, but often leads to overconsumption and waste. As a result, students miss out on savings.
                        <br><br>Our app addresses these challenges by providing a platform where users can find grocery deals, easily find others interested in splitting bulk groceries if needed, coordinate purchases, and handle payments seamlessly. By facilitating collaborative shopping, the app promotes financial savings, sustainability, and good grocery shopping habits.

                <h2>User Research</h2>
                <p>We interviewed various university students (ages 18-21) who regularly cook their own meals. The interviews focused on current grocery habits, pain points, and existing workarounds.</p>

                <div class="process-stage">
                    <p>At first, our app idea overloaded on features aimed to help the user save money. Including a main feed showcasing friends' listings for grocery items they wanted to split, a grocery list tab for managing both private and shared lists, and a search function to find nearby grocery deals.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>The high-fidelity iteration centers around one core feature: efficient grocery list splitting. We refined the user flow to make it easy to create and manage shared lists, track who's contributing what, and settle costs seamlessly. Supporting features like reminders, notifications, and messaging were built around enhancing this central interaction, rather than competing with it.</p>

                                    Many participants wanted to return to the previous page after entering the chat feature.<br>
                                    Some of the fonts were a bit too small, especially on the back button.<br>
                                    Chat background made the texts a bit hard to read.

                                    These issues affect the user's ability to effectively navigate the app's features. The font size and chat colour choices affect the readability of the buttons in our app.
                                </td>
                                <td>
                                    We adjusted the font sizes in our app. This will ensure that our font size is readable and, thus, easy to navigate. An additional wiring is also added to the chat page for the "return" function to work across our app.
                                </td>

                                <td>
                                    This feature is important because we do not want users to make payments they did not mean to. The confirmation page would allow users a chance to cancel the transaction before it is charged onto their account. This ensures users have control over their payments and prevents accidental transactions.
                                </td>
                                <td>
                                    Our app has a separate popup that is prominent enough for the user to confirm they authorize the payment.
                                </td>
                            </tr>

                                    <strong>Notification urgency</strong><br>
                                    
                                </td>
                                <td>
                                    The app notifies users to pay their due balance associated with their grocery-getting goals. Without the sense of urgency, users may dismiss the notification or forget about it. Highlighting urgency ensures users take action on important tasks.
                                </td>
                                <td>
                                    On our popups we highlighted the due dates and changed the colour of the boxes or headings to red. This creates a sense of urgency and "danger" of consequence if the user ignores the notification.
                                </td>
                            </tr>

                                <td>
                                    The search feature makes it easier to add an item to the grocery list rather than inputting the name and details manually. This function saves many users time and personal research efforts. A prominent search function improves usability and reduces user frustration.
                                </td>
                                <td>
                                    The button for this feature is made to be more prominent next to the "add item" button, making its use more obvious.
