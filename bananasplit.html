A collaborative grocery shopping app designed to help university students save money and reduce food waste by sharing bulk purchases.</p>

                <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Grocery shopping is an essential part of university student life, and can pose problems when it comes to managing financial constraints. University students have noticed that groceries have become more expensive, and having that on top of tuition and housing expenses affects their nutrition. According to CBC News, food prices in 2025 could increase by 5% (Heydari 2024). Existing research shows that food costs are on the rise, and in consequence affordability becomes an important factor when it comes to grocery shopping. 
                        <br><br>According to Investopedia, buying in bulk does decrease the cost per unit, but often leads to overconsumption and waste. As a result, students miss out on savings.
                        <br><br>Our app addresses these challenges by providing a platform where users can find grocery deals, easily find others interested in splitting bulk groceries if needed, coordinate purchases, and handle payments seamlessly. By facilitating collaborative shopping, the app promotes financial savings, sustainability, and good grocery shopping habits.

                <h2>User Research</h2>
                <p>We interviewed various university students (ages 18–21) who regularly cook their own meals. The interviews focused on current grocery habits, pain points, and existing workarounds.</p>

                    <li>Users value simplicity, trust, and consistency, don't try to overload a bunch of features in your app. Focus on one core feature and design the app around that.</li>
                    <li>User testing is so so so valuable in gaining insight and ideas you may of missed</li>
